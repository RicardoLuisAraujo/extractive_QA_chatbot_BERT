Around him in four different boxes are Nappa on the top left hand corner, Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo on the top right hand corner, Vegeta on the bottom right hand corner, Korin and Kami on the bottom left hand corner.\\n Kami warps Goku back to Earth Now with their extra three hours provided to them by Vegeta have run out, Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin begin to feel hopeless now that Goku still has not arrived. Vegeta assumes Kakarot must have fled to escape the Saiyans, and Vegeta deems him a coward. Gohan angrily growls that his father his anything but a coward, but Krillin begins to agree with Vegeta, that possibly even this threat was too much for even Goku to be fearless of. As Nappa removes his damaged armor, he cracks his knuckles, and prepares to begin a new round with the Dragon Team, smirking menacingly. Krillin, with no confidence, states this wasteland will be his own grave, and the Earth will cease to exist from this day forward, as there is no hope of even denting the Saiyans now. Piccolo states however, he still has one final plan that is a huge risk, but will pay off greatly if successfully performed. As Krillin and Gohan listen carefully, Piccolo plans that Krillin shall distract Nappa, while Piccolo shall pull at Nappa's tail, remembering how much pain Raditz felt when his tail was pulled. Piccolo then states after he has handicapped Nappa by immobilizing him, Gohan and Krillin shall attack Nappa with everything they have got, and fire their best techniques. Gohan now promises he shall not flee like the last time, with Piccolo replying that if Gohan even thinks of fleeing again, the whole Earth shall fall, and that pressure is more than enough to get Gohan standing his ground. Piccolo calms Gohan by saying if he calms his mind and uses his attacks carefully, he shall probably pass even Piccolo in strength. As Nappa begins to slowly walk towards the trio, Piccolo holds a fighting position, and gets ready to put his plan into action.\\n Korin throws Goku a few Senzu Beans Meanwhile, Kami and Mr. Popo on the Lookout notice that Goku has now ended his return journey on Snake Way and has now returned to King Yemma's office in the Other World, with his mentor for the past few months, King Kai amazed at Goku's progress and power. Teleporting to the office, Kami orders Goku to grab his arm and teleports back to the Lookout as quickly as possible. Wasting no time, Goku thanks Kami for the help and immediately jumps off the Lookout and begins to fly towards the Saiyans and the Z Fighter's battlefield. Korin, nearby on Korin Tower, notices that Goku is extremely tired, and decides to give him the last two Senzu Beans he has on the tower. Goku catches the beans and thanks Korin, swallowing one of the beans, gaining his full energy back, and can now fly at full speed. Goku calls out his Flying Nimbus and heads towards the battle at tremendous speed.\\n Nappa reveals that he and Vegeta have overcome the weakness in their tail Meanwhile, with the Z Fighters, Krillin gives out a loud yell and leaps towards Nappa, following Piccolo's order to distract him. Vegeta however, realizes that they have a hidden plan, as they would not attempt to directly attack Nappa like that head on, but Vegeta still decides not to interfere, wanting Nappa to figure it out for himself. However, surprising Nappa, instead of attacking him, Krillin blasts two ki beams towards the ground and levitates himself into the air, as Nappa looks in confusion, thus making Krillin's attempt to draw Nappa's attention a success. Piccolo, now running as fast as he can, now manages to get behind the Saiyan, and grabs onto his tail, and proceeds to grip it tightly and torture Nappa. Piccolo now orders Gohan to rush in and attack Nappa while he is immobilized. However, in a shocking turn of events, Nappa appears unfazed by Piccolo grabbing his tail, as he elbows Piccolo directly on the head, giving the Namekian a large bruise, and knocking him out cold in one light hit. As Piccolo falls, Nappa grabs his clothing, and orders Piccolo to tell him where the Dragon Balls are. Vegeta begins to laugh, as he questions why the Z Fighters would go for such a stupid tactic against elite Saiyan warriors, who have trained their tails to be stronger against threats.

Unfortunately for Piccolo, Android 17 has the advantage by having an infinite energy flow, thus, he cannot feel fatigue. Piccolo and Android 17 descend back to the ground after fighting in the air for a long period of time. Android 17 lands near Android 16 and Android 18, and praises Piccolo for his surprising newfound strength. Android 17 though, still maintaining his egotistical attitude, informs Piccolo he is still far superior, and that Piccolo's newfound strength will still not be enough to totally decimate the Androids. Android 17 now orders Piccolo to tell of Goku's location, something the Androids have wanted to know due to their programming by the late Dr. Gero, who wanted revenge on Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army and his career. Piccolo, calm and collected, smirks menacingly, telling Android 17 that it will take more than petty threats and a beating to squeeze the information out of him. Not feeling sorry for his opponent, Android 17 promises he will not give Piccolo any mercy, and will now fight seriously. Android 17 lands right next to the concentrating Piccolo, who is now preparing a clever tactic. As Android 17 and Piccolo stare at each other, not flinching or slightly moving, Android 17 manages to land a strike on Piccolo's face, which was far too fast for Piccolo to even attempt to dodge.\\n Android 17 vs. Piccolo Piccolo quickly recovers and tries to make a comeback, attempting to strike 17 in the face also. However, Android 17 ducks and dodges swiftly and calmly, then managing to land a devastating stomach punch, which causes Piccolo to fall slowly in pain. Android 17 speeds Piccolo's falling by elbowing him in the back, knocking him fast first into the dust and grass of the island. Now recovering once again, Piccolo dodges a quick kick from Android 17, backflipping away from 17. Piccolo cracks his stiff neck, not showing any visible signs of weakening or slowing down, and compliments Android 17 on his amazing speed, but that his punches are quite lacking in force. 17, surprised Piccolo as managed to withstand so many attacks, replies that Piccolo is far too confident for his own benefit, and that he will soon learn not to mock an obviously stronger opponent. Android 17 makes a running dash towards Piccolo, his eyes cold and menacing, as he prepares another fatal strike. Piccolo raises his right arm in preparation and attempts a karate chop on Android 17's neck, however, the Android is still too fast for Piccolo to hit, and 17 manages to dodge the attack and flip behind Piccolo, kneeing him directly in his skull. Piccolo retaliates by kicking Android 17 directly in his face. Android 17 makes an even quicker comeback by punching Piccolo as he recovers, but Piccolo once again strikes back by head-butting his foe, making the android fly back many feet, destroying the ground nearby. Android 18 still looks on in surprise and intrigue, amazed and confused as to how Piccolo has gained so much strength in such little time, as Piccolo could not even stand against the Androids in their first encounter. Piccolo and Android 17 continue to dish out more attacks and block them, with neither of them seeming to either give in or tire.\\n The battle rages on Nearby, Cell continues to fly at high speeds, searching for Android 17 and 18 so he can absorb and consume them, in order to reach his perfect state, an unbeatable monster. Cell notices that Piccolo's ki is at high levels and moving around very quickly, meaning he must be fighting some powerful opponent. As Cell cannot feel another source of energy in the same location, Cell figures out it must be one of the androids, as the Androids do not have a Ki Sense that is trackable. Cell now laughs with menace and excitement, now rushing to finally attain his dream and desire, his perfect form. At the Kame House, Tien Shinhan and Krillin also feel Piccolo's energy spiking, and wish they were more powerful so they could help their ally, but Master Roshi insists there is nothing that either of them could do, and that they'd only be a distraction, and therefore, a disadvantage for Piccolo. Tien now senses Cell's ki, and begins to feel absolute dread and worry, knowing how strong the beast is, and that Piccolo will not stand much of a chance with both Cell and 17 to deal with. Chi-Chi runs outside the house to inform Krillin that Bulma is on the phone and wishes to speak to him urgently about a major discovery about the Androids design. Bulma tells Krillin she has found a weakness both Android 17 and Android 18 each have, an emergency off switch, something Dr. Gero built and once planned to use in case either of the Androids stood out of line or tried to betray their creator. Bulma informs Krillin she has a new remote device to shut down the Androids ready, and Krillin urgently orders Bulma to fly over and give it to him now, so he can assist Piccolo in the battle. Tien now begins to feel a slight glimpse of hope, and says Cell will be much less a threat if the two things that he needs to complete his evolution are destroyed. Krillin however, feels doubt and slight sadness that he will have to destroy Android 18, as he has developed an infatuation for Android 18 when she kissed his cheek after she and Android 17 defeated the Dragon Team on the Mountain Road.\\n Meanwhile, still waiting on The Lookout for Vegeta and Future Trunks to emerge from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan and Goku now notice Cell's energy rushing towards Piccolo's. Goku now loses his patience with Vegeta, and knows Vegeta should have achieve a new state of the Super Saiyan form by now. Gohan begins to feel woe for his mentor Piccolo, as Cell gets closer and closer to him.\\n Cell rushes to the battle between Piccolo and Android 17 Piccolo and Android 17 continue to brawl, with Android 17 now at the slight advantage. Piccolo, now getting frustrated his energy is being wasted on useless melee attacks, decides to fire a power Explosive Demon Wave to finally disintegrate Android 17. The powerful Android dodges the attack just barely, and now also he starts to lose patience. Piccolo now begins to breathe heavily in tiredness, which makes Android 17 grin sadistically, reminding Piccolo that he has infinite flowing energy coursing through him. Piccolo however, pays no attention to the Android, as he suddenly feels a powerful energy source; Cell has finally arrived, and looks down upon Piccolo and the androids with glee, preparing to finally achieve his perfect state and become the most powerful entity the universe will ever know.\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6495194342939706, 'meta': {'title': 'Waiting in the Wings', 'chapter_number': '368 (DBZ 174)'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '256f23e0911b4f7ae65b6b4b8ba7e4ab'}>,\n",
